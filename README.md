# heart_disease_prediction

To predict Heart disease using following parameters:

1.age: The person's age in years

2.sex: The person's sex (1 = male, 0 = female)

3.cp: chest pain type
    Value 0: asymptomatic
    Value 1: atypical angina
    Value 2: non-anginal pain
    Value 3: typical angina

4.trestbps: The person's resting blood pressure (mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

5.chol: The person's cholesterol measurement in mg/dl

6.fbs: The person's fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dl, 1 = true; 0 = false)

7.restecg: resting electrocardiographic results
    Value 0: showing probable or definite left ventricular 	hypertrophy by Estes' criteria
    Value 1: normal
    Value 2: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)

8.thalach: The person's maximum heart rate achieved

9.exang: Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

10.oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest ('ST' relates to positions on the ECG plot.)

11.slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (0: downsloping; 1: flat; 2: upsloping)

12.ca: The number of major vessels (0-3)

13.thal: Results of the blood flow observed via the radioactive dye.
 
    Value 1: fixed defect (no blood flow in some part of the heart)
    Value 2: normal blood flow
    Value 3: reversible defect (a blood flow is observed but it is not normal)

14.target : 0 = disease, 1 = no disease
